# Size first - the four rows

Read while scoping, before the verdict's size line: the signals that decide each size and the steps each size runs.

| Size | Signals | Steps that run |
|---|---|---|
| trivial | one file, no new dependency, no behaviour a test would see (typo, comment, format, rename inside a file) | edit -> scoped check -> close. No design, no audit, no stop |
| small | up to 3 files in one domain, no new dependency, no public contract touched | plan inline -> build -> verifier -> close. One stop, the close |
| standard | anything else in one domain | the full gated vertical |
| cross | more than one domain | this pipeline |
